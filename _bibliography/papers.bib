	abstract = {Bio-molecular condensates formed in the cytoplasm of cells are increasingly recognised as key spatiotemporal organisers of living matter and are implicated in a wide range of functional or pathological processes. This opens up a new avenue for condensate-based applications and a crucial step in controlling this process is to understand the underlying interactions driving their formation or dissolution. However, these condensates are highly multi-component assemblies and many inter-component interactions are present, rendering it difficult to identify key drivers of phase separation. In this work, we employ the recently formulated dominance analysis to modulations of condensate formation, centred around dilute phase solute concentration measurements. We posit that mechanisms of action of modulators can be categorised into 4 generic classes with respect to a target solute, motivated by theoretical insights. These classes serve as a general guide towards deducing possible mechanisms on the molecular level, which can be complemented by orthogonal measurements. As a case study, we investigate the modulation of suramin on condensates formed by G3BP1 and RNA, and the dominance measurements point towards a dissolution mechanism where suramin acts on G3BP1 to disrupt G3BP1/RNA interactions, as confirmed by a diffusional sizing assay. Our approach and the dominance framework have a high degree of adaptability and can be applied in many other condensate-forming systems.},

	abstract = {Biomolecular condensates have emerged as prominent regulators of dynamic subcellular organisation and essential biological processes. Temperature, in particular, exerts a significant influence on the formation and behaviour of biomolecular condensation. For example, during cellular heat stress, stress granules (SGs) are formed from RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and RNA, forming liquid condensates to protect the RNA from damage. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to changes in protein phase behaviour are not well understood. To answer how temperature modulates protein interactions and phase behaviour, we developed a high-throughput microfluidic platform, capable of mapping the phase space and quantifying protein interactions in a temperature-dependent manner. Specifically, our approach measures high-resolution protein phase diagrams as a function of temperature, while accurately quantifying changes in the binodal, condensate stoichiometry and free energy contribution of a solute, hence, providing information about the underlying mechanistic driving forces. We employ this approach to investigate the effect of temperature changes on the phase separation of the stress granule scaffold protein Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) with PolyA-RNA. Surprisingly, we find that the G3BP1/RNA phase boundary remains unaffected by the increasing temperature but the underlying stoichiometry and energetics shift, which can only be revealed with high-resolution phase diagrams. This indicates that temperature-induced dissolution is counteracted by entropic processes driving phase separation. With increasing temperature, the G3BP1 content in condensates decreases alongside with a reduction of the free energy of protein interactions, while the RNA content increases driven by entropically favoured hydrophobic interactions. In the context of cellular heat SG formation, these findings could indicate that during heat shock, elevated temperatures directly induce RNA recruitment to stress granules as a cytoprotective mechanism by finetuning the strength of protein and RNA interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe Authors declare the following competing interests: T.P.J.K. and P.S.G.-H. are a co-founders and H.A., D.Q., R.S. and S.Q. are employees or consultants for Transition Bio; C.M.F. and T.S. declare no competing interests.},
