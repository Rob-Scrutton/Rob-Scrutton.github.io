Hi! I'm a 2nd year Chemistry PhD student and my research covers the following topics:

1. Understanding phase separation using microfluidics and physical chemistry techniques (check out our preprint down below where characterise the internal pH of condensates using these techniques!)
2. Sequence-based machine learning to build predictive models for in vivo protein phase separation
3. Using CNNs to analyse data from high-throughput droplet microfluidics and develop screening platforms
4. Predicting the in vivo composition of condensates using VAEs and related techniques from cell-based imaging
